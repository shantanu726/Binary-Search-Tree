APP1::::::
Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree using Recursion:
To solve the problem follow the below idea:

For Binary search tree, while traversing the tree from top to bottom the first node which lies in between the two numbers n1 and n2 is the LCA of the nodes, i.e. the first node n with the lowest depth which lies in between n1 and n2 (n1<=n<=n2) n1 < n2. 

So just recursively traverse the BST , if nodeâ€™s value is greater than both n1 and n2 then our LCA lies in the left side of the node, if it is smaller than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies on the right side. Otherwise, the root is LCA (assuming that both n1 and n2 are present in BST)

Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

Create a recursive function that takes a node and the two values n1 and n2.
If the value of the current node is less than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies in the right subtree. Call the recursive function for the right subtree.
If the value of the current node is greater than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies in the left subtree. Call the recursive function for the left subtree.
If both the above cases are false then return the current node as LCA.
